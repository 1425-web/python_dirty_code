A dictionary is a reference book containing an alphabetical list of words, with information given for each word, usually including meaning, pronunciation, and etymology.
As an informational text, dictionaries serve a distinctive function. They provide details about words â€“ their definitions, usages, pronunciations, and origins.
The stark difference between dictionaries and other forms of text is their specific, focused approach. Dictionaries do not weave narratives or present arguments. Instead, they exist to provide straightforward, specific, and factual information about language.
For readers, dictionaries serve as an authoritative source, offering factual and definitive information about the words of a specific language.
